# Koan learnings:

# Insert at a specific index with list.insert(index, thing)

aList = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]

aList.insert(2, 2)
print(aList)

# A lot of tuple and set magic, especially nesting

# Please, don't do this: "foo" " " "bar"

aList.pop(2)
print(aList)

# Regular expressions!
# Regular - formatted in a consistent way
# Expression - a string of things to match
