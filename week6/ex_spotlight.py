## 1. Write a function that, given a string and an index, prints the character at that index.
#
# def illuminate(source, idx=0):
# ...
# illuminate('Hollywood', 1)) # prints 'o'

## 2. Update your function so that it prints "index" number of spaces, then the character at that index.
#
# def illuminate(source, idx=0):
# ...
# illuminate('Hollywood', 4) # prints '    y'

## 3. Write function that, given a string, prints each letter, with spaces in front matching its position in the string.
#
# def spotlight(source):
# ...
# spotlight('Hollywood') # prints:
# 'H'
# ' o'
# '  l'
# ...etc...

## 4. Update your function from step #3 to `import time` and sleep for 1/4 second after each letter.
#
# def spotlight(source, delay=.25):

## 5. Update your function from step #4 to `import os` and then use `os.system('clear')` to clear the screen after each letter.
## 6. Write a function that uses the one from step #5 to "sweep" back and forth across the string, like a spotlight.
